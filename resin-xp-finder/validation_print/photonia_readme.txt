Photonia Calibration Test File

First, it is assumed you have already run the Resin Exposure Tests to find the optimal settings and exposure for your machine and resin. If you have not done this step, stop right here. Go do the Exposure Test first. 

Once you have your optimal exposure settings, load the photonia test file into the Validator program and input your optimal exposure settings. Save the new file to usb stick, and run the test print. 

A quick and easy way is to just print the Photonia test file as is, and in the printer touchscreen menu, manually input your exposure settings. 

Do not reslice the Photonia test file. The file is built direct from pixel perfect layer images. If it is resliced, the slicer will introduce anomalies and thus negates the test. 


What is the Photonia test file? 

- Designed layer by layer at pixel level starting at 1 x 1px in negative and positive space. 
- Shows you the true area of print and each side step tells you how many microns your LCD mask eats away. 
- Tests your plate level by printing a full plane. 
- Tests your light distribution by printing sharp steep spiral stairs at 7 special points. 
- Shows you the resin opacity with each layer allowing you to better plan you thickness. Eg. litophane printing. 
- Shows you the minimum positive and negative detail your machine/resin/exposure combo can produce and what can be washed away. 
- Extrenal shallow columns show you the maximum detail, height, internal columns show you how good your washing skills or the resin tenacity. 
- Indicates the plate coordinates so you can detect potential issues and always be able to track them on your machine plate. 
- Indicates how easy the resin is to clean on the tallest negative holes. 
- Does not make your coffee. 

Enjoy. Happy Printing. Hail Photonia! 
Photonia blesses sanders with multiple print failures.
